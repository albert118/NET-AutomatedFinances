About
*****

This project encompasses development of several finance automation, visualisation and management tools. Designed for personal (single user) use. Currently this supports:
 * scraping NetBank data and preprocessing (then importing) data from NetBank as well as [ADP](https://developers.adp.com/metadata/collections/all/learn)(payroll service),
 * calculating several useful statistics from the data,
 * configurable categories and subcategories for expenditure, income and savings data,
 * category and subcategory visualisations for expenditure, income and savings data (always more coming!),
 * some dynamic control over the dataframe management to reduce hard coding labels, headers, etc... (more to come).
